# Skin Cancer Classification 
>  To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- What is the background of your project?
Among all the skin cancer type, melanoma is the least common skin cancer, but it is responsible for 75% of death SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification, 2020. Being a less common skin cancer type but is spread very quickly to other body parts if not diagnosed early. The International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) is facilitating skin images to reduce melanoma mortality. Melanoma can be cured if diagnosed and treated in the early stages. Digital skin lesion images can be used to make a teledermatology automated diagnosis system that can support clinical decision.

Currently, deep learning has revolutionised the future as it can solve complex problems. The motivation is to develop a solution that can help dermatologists better support their diagnostic accuracy by ensembling contextual images and patient-level information, reducing the variance of predictions from the model.

- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
 You don't have to ansThe first step to identify whether the skin lesion is malignant or benign for a dermatologist is to do a skin biopsy. In the skin biopsy, the dermatologist takes some part of the skin lesion and examines it under the microscope. The current process takes almost a week or more, starting from getting a dermatologist appointment to getting a biopsy report. This project aims to shorten the current gap to just a couple of days by providing the predictive model using Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD). The approach uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify nine types of skin cancer from outlier lesions images. This reduction of a gap has the opportunity to impact millions of people positively.wer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

- What is the dataset that is being used?

The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.
